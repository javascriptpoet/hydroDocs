##Synopsis
Describes system operation under computer control.

##Valve settings
* [M1](valve diagram) - open
* [M2](valve diagram) - closed
* [M3](valve diagram) - open
* [M4](valve diagram) - closed
* [M5](valve diagram) - closed
* [M6](valve diagram) - closed
* [M7](valve diagram) - closed
* [M8](valve diagram) - closed
* [M9](valve diagram) - open
* [M10](valve diagram) - closed

##Other considerations
* Computer must be powered on. That takes plugging both power supplies (arduino supply and relay output supply) in one of the utility power strips. It is best to plug both of them into the same strip to avoid weird failure modes when one of the strips trips.
* Main pump must be plugged into [main pump plug](electrical connections)
* Nutrient mixing pump should be off. It generates too much heat to be continuously on. Turn it on only when adjusting the nutrient tank.  

>NOTE:  
When computer is powered on, it will immediately perform a flood/drain cycle.
