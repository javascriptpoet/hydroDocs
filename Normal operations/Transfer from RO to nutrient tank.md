##Synopsis
Describes how to transfer RO water from RO tank to Nutrient tank using main pump. In case of power outage, refer to [emergency transfer from RO to Nutrient tank](emergency/Transfer from RO to Nutrient tank).

>NOTE:  
If computer decides to do fill/drain cycle during the transfer, don't worry, just let it do it. However, avoid doing the transfer during fill/drain cycle. 

##What to do
* Set valves as described below.
* Plug main pump to one of the outlets on [utility power strip](Wiring diagram)
* Wait for the pump to transfer RO water to your liking.
* Unplug the main pump. Do not plug it under computer control yet in case it kicks off fill/drain cycle while you are playing with the valves
* Restore valves to [normal computer operation](Computer operation)
* Plug the main pump into [main pump outlet](Wiring diagram)
