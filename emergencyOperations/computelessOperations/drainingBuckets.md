##Synopsis
Describes how to drain the buckets without computer help using the main pump. In case when main pump is not available (e.g. power/pump failure), use [emergency drain](Emergency drain) procedure.
It is presumed that the buckets are flooded at the start of manual drain.  
If computer fill/drain starts during manual drain, no big deal. You can just let it do its thing without any harm.
>**WARNING:  
Do not allow the main pump to run dry for too long. It will overheat and burn up.**

##What to do
* Set valves as described below.
* Plug [main pump](Valve diagram) into one of [utility power strips](Wiring diagram)
* Wait 6mins or until no more nutrient solution is returning back into the nutrient tank.
* Plug [main pump](Valve diagram) into the [main pump outlet](Wiring diagram).


##Valve settings.
Valves need to remain as in [normal computer operations](Computer operations)
