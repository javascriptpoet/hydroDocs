##Synopsis
Describes how to fill the buckets without computer help and without flooding the place.  
The buckets must be drained before normal computer operations are restored to avoid flooding.
>**WARNING:  
if computer starts its fill/drain cycle during manual fill, flooding can occur.**

##What to do

* Make sure that the solenoid valve S1 is not open under computer control before or during manual fill.  
This is indicated by the red LED on lower relay board. It comes on when solenoid fill valve [S1](valve diagram) is open. 
If computer decides to start fill/drain cycle during manual fill, don't panic. Wait till buckets are full and do one of:  
    * Unplug the computer.  
Be aware that it will do another fill/drain cycle on restart, so, make sure buckets are empty before that happens.  
    *  Close valve M9 or M1.  
Make sure to open it when system is put under computer control.
* Set valves.
* Wait 12mins.  
But keep an eye on the red led to note if computer starts new fill/drain cycle.
   
* Terminate manual fill by setting valves for the next operation or [normal computer operation](Computer operation)
