## Synopsis
Emergency procedures are not normal operations. This chapter describes the best remedies for unhappy events, such as power outages, failed equipment or just general bad luck. The system has enough manual overrides to handle it all up to a nuclear war but, perhaps, including it. 

As you will find, it is completely possible, if not annoying, to operate the system manually without computer or power assist. Gravity, however, is still required.

Here is the system capabilities available for handling bad omen.

### Powerless bypass of solenoid valve [S1](Valve diagram)
The S1 solenoid valve is normally controlled by the computer and is for flooding buckets with nutrients during flood/drain cycles. However,  it can always be bypassed thru manual valve M?. Dont forget to close it before loosing nutrient tank on the floor.

### Powerless drain capability
One disadvantage of the way system is set up is the necessity to use power and a pump to drain the buckets back into the nutrient tank. In case a teaspoon is not a good option, manual valve M10 provides a way to drain the flooded buckets manually. It is positioned below the bucket level but above the one on the floor. So, use yet another bucket and shuttle the juice back into the nutrient tank about 5-6 times.

### Powerless drain of both tanks
Normally, it is best to use the pump when draining the RO or the nutrient tanks ([Normal draining of nutrient tank](Draining of nutrient tank),[Normal draining of RO tank](Draining of RO tank)) using the main pump. Besides saving time, it allows to dump thru the front door above the tanks.  

However, if the main pump is not available, the tanks can be drained by gravity ([Emergency drain of nutrient tank](Emergency drain of nutrient tank),[Emergency drain of RO tank](Emergency drain of RO tank)), obviously, below the tanks.

### Powerless transfer from RO to nutrient tank
Again, normally, the [main pump assistance](Transfer from RO to Nutrient tank) should be used but, if not, just [use a bucket](Emergency transfer from RO to Nutrient tank), of course.

### Powerless mixing of nutrient tank
A gal with a long arm? A ski pole ... ? A kayak paddle? Whatever you use, make sure to mix it when doing [nutrient tank adjustment](Adjustment of nutrient tank))

### Powerless ... what if whole tank is on the floor, power is out and nothing in RO tank
First, get a flashlight, then:  
* Scoop enough solution off the floor and save it in ... buckets. Use that solution to water the plants one bucket at a time if needed, collecting it back into the buckets each time.  
    This will keep the plants alive indefinitely but by far not ideal for growth. 
* Collect a few buckets worth of RO water out of RO filter, add some nutrients (use a rough estimate of 8/16ml/gal of bloom/micro for 1300ppm strength), do as described above.

Start collecting RO water into RO tank.

### Power backups
Not much at the moment except for the ph/ppm meter which runs off the battery.  

>Note to the future  
It is not a bad idea to connect [utility power strips](Wiring diagram) thru an UPS battery backup. This will provide main and mixing pump assist for all operations and even computer assist. However, it would not be wise to let the normal computer operations to go on. That would not last too long - the main pump is power hungry. The best would be to disconnect the computer completely and plug it back in sparingly to water the plants. Basically, its a good way to adjust main cycle timing if messing with software is not desired. Remember, computer will do the flood/drain cycle on startup. Wait and disconnect again.
