##Synopsis
The computer controls solenoid valve S1 to fill the buckets with the nutrient solution. It is possible to override computer control with the manually bypass valve M7.

>NOTE  
You, now, in charge of timing, so, dont forget to close M7 before having a flood.
Watch out for computer deciding to open S1 in meantime. That can cause extended fill time and flooding.
It is a good idea to drain the buckets before restoring computer control or ... flooding can occur.
