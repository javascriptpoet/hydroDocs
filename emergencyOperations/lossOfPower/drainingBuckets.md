##Synopsis
It is possible to drain the buckets manually when main pump is not available.  
First, get another bucket, then, place it under the spigot coming off valve M10. It is raised over the floor to be below bucket level but above the extra one on the floor. Takes about 5-6 trips back to the nutrient tank.
