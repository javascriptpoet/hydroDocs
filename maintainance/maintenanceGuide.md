## Grochek Combo Monitor HI 991404 pH EC TDS Meter 
This is an extremely important and, at the same time, error prone part of the system. It should be maintained very diligently and never completely trusted. It is the best to have a second reliable ph and ppm meter to keep both true.  
The meter should be regularly calibrated according to the manufacturer procedures. (link will be supplied later). The ph probe should be never allowed to be dry. If taken out of the nutrient tank, it should be kept in storage solution and nothing else. RO water will damage it. It is best to use the tight fitting cap that came with the probe. Make sure to fill it with the storage solution.  
The ppm probe is less sensitive and can be dry. Still, it needs to be calibrated regularly as accuracy of ppm readings is by far more important then ph readings. If you decide to get a backup meter, invest into a decent ppm meter first. 

>NOTE:
The meter is designed for continuous reading. It is not a good idea or will work very well to use it out of the nutrient tank for ad hoc testing. For best results, just leave it alone.
Also, the meter is prone to turning itself off, prbly, due to power supply glitches due to operation of other equipment, e.g. pumps. If you find it off, dont panic, just turn it on and give it a few minutes to settle down. It has a very lowpass filter. 
Keep all its cords, power and probes, away from any other power cords to minimize power glitches.

##Between cycles maintenance
* cleaning  
The system should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. It is recommended to run a few fill/drain cycles of weak bleach solution. 

* grow rocks  
should be desalted at least between the grow cycles but, perhaps once during each cycle. Do not use clear RO water on live plants, they dont like drastic ppm changes. A solution of clearex should be used.

    The old roots should be removed out of each bucket. It is recommended to dump each bucket onto a screen, clean with tap water and pick whatever roots can be taken out. It is not necessary to get 100% of the roots but accumulation of dead roots thru multiple grow cycles is not a good idea.  

* nutrient tank  
should be washed with a weak bleach solution and any solid sediment from previous grow removed. If there is an idle time between grow cycles, keep nutrient tank empty, dry and clean but dont forget to take ph and ppm probes out and properly store them.
* lights
Glass lenses inside light hoods should be cleaned of dust buildup.

Thats it.
